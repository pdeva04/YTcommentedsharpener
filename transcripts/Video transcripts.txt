Video 1:  Reality of placements

Hello friends, welcome to the channel. My name is Devashish and this is an Ed Sharpener Production.
In this video, I am going to tell you about
the reality of pay packages that are given in premiere institutes in India,
in the placement season, of course.
There are two objectives of this video:
The first objective is (for) the audience, basically, which is media, parents and the society.
Alright! So these audience have some hyped-up expectations
regarding the pay packages of the students who study in such (premiere) institutes.
Or whatever pay packages they hear about,
we will burst the myth around these.
We will do this, not because these expectations are bad,
but because the hype badly affects the students.
One expects that my their child will study at IIT,
and that they will perform the best!
Here I am, a real like example, who despite being an IITian, couldn't perform my "best".
So, it is not (entirely) true that once you get into an IIT, your life is set..
.. or that all the IITians get very high packages.
This is a myth.
You must have heard the media telling every year, that
a certain student from a certain IIT
has grabbed a package of 1.7 crores.
This is one of the dumbest thing that you have heard, that goes on in the media.
Why?
Because they are directly converting
whatever pay package they would earn in USA, in US Dollars
straight away into Indian Rupees.
And then it is published, and one believes, that really they are being paid in crores.
There is a purchasing parity between US and India, which basically means that when you buy things in USA as compared to India, you pay slightly pay more in US.
So, if they are earning in US, they are also spending in US, right?
So its equivalent in India is not in crores, but about 30-40 lacks in say (a city like) Bangalore.
So that means, someone who is earning is crores in USA is equivalent to someone who earns about 30/40 lacs in Bangalore.
So you must understand this. In this video I will mostly talk about M.Tech people, their placement scenario, and discuss the reality of packages.
I will share with you some factual figures.
The other objective that I have for making this video is YOU - my viewers who will get an M.Tech admission in the future.
You will register during the placement season.
What I am about to tell you, will help you in making good and correct decisions.
That is my second objective behind making this video - to make you aware.

So, let us start with the CTC. Alright!
During placement season, you will see all the companies display a CTC- cost to company - figure on the registration portal..
For example when a company say XYZ, pays 30 lakhs package, it is CTC. So, when you qualify the interview and get selected, you are like "yay 30 lakhs!!"
You have told everyone, your parents, friends, relatives, etc.
You later realize that this 30 lakhs is CTC. What you get in hand is only around 15 lakhs.
SO, what about the remaining 15 lakhs?
Some of this amount will be gifted to as company shares, alright?
Some of it might be joining bonus, meaning just because you are joining now, you get a bonus this year.
Then why do they advertise all this hyped up package?
I have discussed this point in this video (link up here) about the negotiations that happen in the placement cells.
When a company want an early or day-one slot - what does it mean by early slot?
It is the slot when they have a higher chance of recruiting better students, meaning, if the company interviews early, better (and more) students will appear.
To earn this day one slot, the companies compete with one another, with respect to packages.
So all companies naturally blow up their packages a bit.
So their base pay is 15 lakh only, but for that year, they say that the CTC is 30lakh!
So how do they justify the remaining 15 lakhs? They say that you get 12 lakhs in shares, spanned out over 3 years.
So you will receive or use the 4lakhs worth of shares per year..
The rest of it can be joining bonus or food allowance.
So the highest packages offered to M.Tech (or even BTech) are similarly distributed.
One of the actual figures grabbed from one of the top IITs is 28Lakhs..
It's a friend, and of course won't mention which IIT this story is from, but...
out of that 28Lakhs, the base pay is 20 Lakh.
And this was the highest base pay (that year in that institute). We are talking about a student from Computer Science Engineering.
The rest of that was shares and all. So now you know the break-up.
As a thumb rule, almost always you can assume that that amount you finally receive in-hand is 20-30% less than CTC.
And this in-hand amount received is taxable again...
You can have those kind of high expectations, because there are companies that offer to pay packages of 40 lakhs..
but their base pay is 12 lakhs. So they have performance based bonuses and all,
meaning you will receive the last remaining 3 lakhs only if you perform well. There are so many things that form the CTC.

So, whenever you apply for a company, always check the CTC.
Why? Because you have to submit a priority list when you register during the placement season.
You know that several companies are recruiting, and suppose you appear for several interviews with different companies.
And if you are selected by multiple companies,
Then you have to submit this priority list, of which company you prefer joining more than the others. And you cannot change this list later.
And that is why you must know beforehand, which company you would prioritize.
Also, a lot of people commit the mistake of registering for all the companies.
Now some of the companies can also secure the day-one slot because
they are mass recruiters. They recruit 50 or 60 students, even if they offer less package.
So, if there are lots of vacancies, then also companies get the day one slot.
But several students too fall prey to this trap by registering for these mass recruiter companies.
If you are from a specially (booming) branches like CS, Electronics, Electrical, you can get better opportunities
Analytics companies, for instance can mass recruit students from
branches like mechanical or civil engineering or other interdisciplinary branches which have fewer core jobs openings.
But if you are from CS or IT, then you can get placed in good core CS companies
So register smartly.
Set up your priority list after considering the base pays, not the CTC.
Always consult the seniors regarding their experiences.

If you are researching externally about the placement scenario of a certain branch,
try to find the median pay, not the average (mean) pay for (for previous years)
Many student look for the average pay for a department (or branch).
This can be misguiding because of a few students who had very high packages, and that increased the average pay for the branch.
Another important thing to note is also that those students who grab these very high packages
like 20 or 30 lakhs (even if it is base pay) are very few and far between per institute.
The rest of the students have lesser base packages.
So, assume that most companies pay 10-15 lakhs on average.
In hand salary will be then 10-12 Lakhs, or sometimes even less like 8 lakhs.
These are not bad packages. But if you expect getting rich after getting into IIT, that is absolutely not true.
The packages are normal.
And every college will have a similar scenario.
Please don't over hype this, that is all I want to say.
I have one more experience to share with you about this registration process. Its a friend's friend's experience.

They registered for all the companies, and then
But then they got selected, and had to join a company where they didn't want to join at all.
They also told during the interview that they don't want to join, but the company still recruited them.
Because the company also wants to show off that they did really select a lot of students.
So, the company won't be accountable, they are just completing their recruitment targets.
So what happened was, this friend had put this company on their priority list,
But they later learnt that this base pay for this company is low, or that better companies would be recruiting on later dates, etc...
But all that was missed out.
There are so many things that go on in the placement season.
So remember all this, and make sure to decide likewise.

I believe this video has done the myth-busting. So, do not expect too much from your children if you are a parent.
It is wrong to expect that your child must earn a certain package, etc.
The pay packages are quite normal in almost all institutes.
They are just represented in a blown up manner during placement season.
There are very few students who will grab those very high paying packages.
..probably only 1 percent.
The rest of the students get normal, average packages only.
So try to settle on that. And please don't think that you are worthless because you are (apparently) not earning enough.
If you extrapolate this - your situation - (to the future)..
while you are working in a company..
you will experience how much (more) you can earn eventually.
You will get to know the reality, alright!
If you have any doubts regarding this, please write to me in the comments section.
Please share this video as much as you can. This is an important video, and everyone must know the reality about the pay packages.

Yeah, I almost forgot to tell you.. which types of companies and their packages I reviewed (for priority list)
I had made this video yesterday ..
.. where I have discussed the number of companies that visit each department.
I am telling you the average range of packages, won't name the companies though.
Wherever I applied, here is what they had to offer
13lpa (lakhs per annum) , 12lpa, 15lpa, 8lpa, 6lpa, 10lpa,
and so many.. same range of salaries. I hadn't appear for any company that offered more than 15lpa.
So, someone like me who had a low pointer still got the chance as I was eligible. I cleared the written test.
You all get a chance to grab a good package. I was from an Interdisciplinary department.
We didn't have very good placements from our department.
So, don't worry even if you are
from let's say - Civil, Mechanical..
You will get a good package from good companies, if they are even remotely related to your branch.
It's not impossible,
so, don't lose hope!
It's also not true, that you will be suddenly rich of you get a big package.
It will be mostly normal/ average..
and you can easily grab it!
Just don't compare yourself with others.
You and all the parents too, please
stop comparing yourselves with others.
And, do your best!
Make yourself eligible, and I will
keep helping you through this channel.
Also, please subscribe to this
channel, if you haven't already.. Alright!
And, lets meet soon. Till then, gyaan pite rahiye!


Video 2: M-Tech vs M.S. in IITs

Hello all viewers, welcome to the channel. My name is Devashish. 
And in this video, we will highlight the differences between M.Tech and MS (Research) 
So watch till the end! 
So first of all let us talk about the elementary differences between M.Tech and MS (Research). 
MS research is (obviously) a research oriented course. 
Whereas M.Tech is like a shorter version of B.Tech, 
almost as if you compressed the B.Tech into 2 years course, then it might look like M.Tech. 
Just like in B.Tech, when you take 4/5 courses 
per semester, you do the same in M.Tech as well; 
and in the end you also complete a project. 
And this is how you can achieve your M.tech degree. 
With respect to the duration, the M.Tech is typically a 2 year 
course and there are not many resistances involved. 
So, most of the time, there are no issues facing you.  
In my case, when I was pursuing M.tech,
 my project had to be extended by 2 months. 
At the most, a project will be extended by a 
maximum of 6 months. But that is a very rare case. 
So in general, an M.Tech course can be completed in 2 years on average. 
Now coming to MS (research),    
it says that the minimum duration of the course is 2 years, which is true... 
but on an average the students who pursue MS say that  
MS course completion takes about 2.5 years. 
So, it may happen that you require 3 years, 
3.5 years, or even just  2 years. 
So, it is absolutely not true that the time duration for 
the completion of both these courses is the same. 
But there is no need to worry, since MS is basically a research oriented program,  
which means, until your research is complete, 
your course is not complete as well. 
Another elementary difference is that your MS (research) 
is a lot dependent on your professor (guide). 
Basically what happens when you apply for the MS(research) course, 
you have to decide your research project
 right away when the course starts. 
So you meet the professor and decide the project that 
 you will both be working on for the duration of your MS. 
Most of the times, your professor will provide 
you with projects to choose from. 
So you can choose from them, depending on your interests. 
You will also be interviewed after registration. 
So whichever professor from the interview 
panel chooses you will be your guide. 
In MS, you don't have to complete as
 many courses like you do in M.Tech. 
You only have to take 3 to 4 courses for completion, 
and usually the professor will help you
 choose which subjects to take up. 
So, it's the professor's project, and the professor's 
guidance on your courses as well. 
So since we have gone over the elementary differences, you must have understood that 
your MS degree completion depends 
a lot on your professor in the case of MS. 
So, until your professor is satisfied, 
that you have done well to earn 
the degree, you probably won't. 
That's not the case in M.Tech. There are several 
  restrictions on the professors too. 
In M.tech, the professors too chill and don't pressure you 
too much, and will pass you without any hassle. 
There is not much load with respect to the project, 
as this is specialisation in a subject. This is like B.Tech only. 
When it comes to MS (research) you are actually getting prepared for PhD. 
So, it can happen when you get an admission in MS (research),  
that your professor will pursue you to join for PhD under his guidance. 
This is because the professors at IITs and NITs are also 
under the pressure to regularly publish research,  
and also to have under their guidance doctoral and post doctoral candidates. 
 So therefore, many professors will pursue their MS 
students to go for PhD under their guidance. 
That does not happen in M.Tech. 
Now let's talk about jobs.  
Many students feel that they might have fewer 
job opportunities after MS as compared to M.Tech. 
That is not at all true. 
Whether it is an MS or an M.Tech student, 
everyone in an IIT or NIT is eligible for placements. 
So this is absolutely wrong to assume that 
there are fewer job opportunities for MS students. 
But really, which student (MS or M.Tech) is preferred by 
the companies that hold campus placement interviews? 
This is a very valid question. 
It all depends on the company and the profile for which they are recruiting. 
So assume this: you are an MS student, and working on a wind energy related project. 
And say, Suzlon which is a wind energy company, is hiring. 
Also, there is another student from M.Tech, who is specialising in energy studies, renewable energy. 
In this case, Suzlon might prefer the MS student 
working specifically on wind energy, 
inspite of the fact the M.tech 
student also studies renewable energy. 
The M.Tech student can have an advantage that 
they have studied at least 15 subjects in 2 years. 
They also have elective courses. 
So for some companies, having learnt a lot of stuff 
in a short time frame is quite attractive. 
So in such a company interview, the several courses 
that you have taken can improve your chances of getting hired. 
Say, for instance, it is me or any other student who has learnt any coding language, 
Then I will get the preference over the MS student
 in a coding related job/company. 
 Now if you have understood this, you must also remember that 
the final objective of pursuing MS is RESEARCH, and not a job. 
If you want a job, you should prefer pursuing M.Tech. 
This is my personal opinion and suggestion. 
And if you have an aptitude for research, then you should pursue 
MS after B.Tech. It will be good for your career in research. 
But at the same time, it is also not true that if you are 
an M.Tech student will not get preference for PhD. 
You can of course join PhD after your M.Tech without any issues, 
and enter the research field comfortably. 
But in any scenario, if you are research oriented and an MS student, then it is always comparatively very easy to get into PhD. 
Another important factor: many friends of mine told me -  publishing your research is required for completing MS. It's an unwritten rule. 
And if you have published your research in a good journal, 
it is quite beneficial for your research profile.  
It is not a necessity in M.Tech. 
Many M.Tech students do publish their research. 
But since it is not necessary, it does not affect your profile, 
and the professor will not push you for it. 
So your research profile might not form as well after completing M.Tech. 
All this stuff goes on in MS. 
But talking about the disadvantages of pursuing MS, 
many MS students have informed that you might not have enough time for placement (related skill upgrading) and for other activities. 
Many MS students also believe that since all of this depends a lot on your professor, 
if they are chill, you will get time for other stuff like your extracurriculars, other skill upgrading studies, etc. 
But if your professor is strict, and keeps pushing you all the time, 
then you might not get time for anything else. 
So, I this this is a concise guideline for you so as to help you choose between MS and M.Tech. 
There are many options open after B.Tech completion, and if you got to IITs for MS or M.Tech, 
then remember all the things that we just talked about. 
I hope that this video was quite informative for you. 
If you have any more questions that I have not answered here, please comment those, and I will surely answer them. 
And please share this video as much as possible, because once the pandemic is gone after some time, then the admissions will start. 
And so, you better start preparing for the interviews.

Video 3: How to apply for assistant professor job in IITs/NITs

 
Hello friends, welcome to this channel. 
My name is Devashish and this is an Ed Sharpener Production. 
Yesterday, we had a Live Session, 
in which I discussed about my personal experiences related to GATE. 
And, (now) about how after (M.Tech from) IITD, I applied for assistant professor job 
is what we will discuss today in this video. 
In the Live session yesterday,  
there were some glitches, and probably this part (from the session) went missing. So I am repeating it here. 
So, this is just an informative video. 
For those who, after getting into IITs and NITs, want to get into academia and professorship,   
we will discuss the options available to them. 
So, when the placement season begins, that is after second semester. 
 
It means you have completed one year in Mtech. 
And then the placement season begins. 
All students are (usually) eligible for all the non-core companies in placements. 
It means any companies that are not related to your branch, but need analytical skills, business skills, 
and will recruit based on such grounds; all the students are eligible for these companies. 
And you will also be eligible for core companies, so long as those companies visit your campus for placements. 
Other than these, the third option are private engineering colleges which create B.tech graduates. 
Several of these colleges visit for campus placements for recruitment of Mtech graduates who will work as assistant professors in their institutes. 
I got admitted in IITD in 2015, and the placement season was in 2016. 
 
At that time, the scenario was that several private colleges had registered for placements. There was a long list. 
There were institutes/colleges like Petroleum University Dehradun, DTU (Delhi Technological University), 
then there were some colleges from Jaipur, 
Some from Madhya Pradesh, 
several colleges from around the Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), etc. 
So all these colleges had registered for campus placement, meaning they had assured that they will recruit IITD students in this placement season. 
But what happened actually was that none of these colleges visited the IITD campus for recruitment that year. 
My objective was to apply for the assistant professor grade. 
Inspite if that I had also appeared for several non-core interviews, 
I have talked about that in the live session yesterday. 
But primarily, I wanted to become an Assistant professor only. 
But that year, no private colleges visited the campus placement, despite having themselves registered. 
So I had to apply off campus. 
For all those who are applying off campus, I want to tell, especially you something. 
 
Basically, you must write a lot of emails. 
So the general procedure to follow is like this: 
First you visit the particular college's website. 
When you scroll down, you find several sections. 
Click on the 'Careers' section on the website. 
You will either get an option to fill up a form right there as an applicant, 
asking your basic details like name, graduation degree, etc. 
And there are also details like your favourite subject, what you would like to teach, etc. 
Then you just submit that form. 
This is one kind of an application. 
Otherwise in the 'Careers' section, you will get an email address where you can send your application.  
I had created an email template, where I would just change the name of the college, and the rest remained the same. 
You usually mention in the email that you are pursuing Mtech from (your) college name, 
and that you would like to apply for the assistant professor position in your department. 
So you are basically applying to a department, 
and the email is sent to the HR of the college. 
That is how you write the application email, just make a template, and you can start applying everywhere. 
 
I must tell you, many private colleges need IITians, NITians who 
are Mtech graduates, as their assistant professors. 
I have mentioned in one of the previous videos where I discussed (the topic): New IITs vs Old NITs that, 
the institution from which you graduated matters a lot. Mention that in your application email. It grabs the HR's attention quickly. 
Just don't gorget to do that in your email. 
 
Now this is my experience, I wrote a similar email to the Galgotia's College. 
Along with this, within 3 months, I must have written and sent at least 240 email applications. 
And out of those 240, I received a reply from only about 10 or 20 places. 
The reply being, that I am being called for an interview for placement. 
So you can see, you get very few replies. So make sure you send out a lot of applications, so that you get as many replies as possible. 
Coming back, I applied to Galgotia's college for the assistant professor vacancy. 
They interviewed me around May end, or June beginning. 
And my Mtech project submission was around June 25th. 
And after about 15 days of the interview, they called me and said that I am selected and must join immediately on the next day. 
But I was not in a position to accept this joining (my MTP was not yet submitted). So I had to deny this opportunity.  
And then when I had actually completed MTech, I did not have a job. 
So I kept applying. Kept sending out emails. I would at least send out 2 emails every day. 
I did this in April, May, June and July. 
 
So for about 3 to 4 months, I had constantly sent out application emails to several colleges. 
I got a lot of replies too, and calls for interviews as well. 
But sometimes, it was not possible for me to appear for every interview. Jaipur, Bhuvaneshwar, etc : the places were too far away and I had to skip those opportunities. 
But since Galgotia's College was in Delhi NCR, I was in IITD, I could easily appear for that one. 
So anyways, my interview went very well. Now usually they ask you to show how you would teach a concept or something similar. 
But I wasn't asked to teach anything, They just interviewed me on my Major project.  
That was what we had discussed. Nothing too technical was asked. 
But usually when they interview for assistant professor job, they ask you to teach a topic of your choice on board. 
So it is very important that you go prepared in such a way that you could teach that topic. 
 In short, these interviews are very easy. They ask you your favourite subject and so long as you have deep understanding of your subject it will be easy for you. 
Coming back to topic, I had no job when Mtech course completed. And I had missed the opportunity to join Galgotia's College as at that time my final project  was not completed. 
 
I later came back to Maharashtra after college and project submission, etc. Then, I got a call again from Galgotia's college  that if I was still interested, I could join in the next two days. 
So I told them that yeah I can join in the next two days. And I just inquired about the salary. 
They asked me my expectations. 
So I told them my salary expectations.  
They tried to bargain. But I stayed put on my expectations. 
So they told me that they would let me know later on. 
And they called back just 5 minutes after. 
And the deal was sealed. I just had to join within 2 days. 
I replied, "on my way!"  
So that's it! For off campus placement, just keep applying! 
All the other expectations like location, notice period, etc 
should be kept as low as possible and you will benefit greatly. 
In my case I benefitted by assuring to join within 2 days when I was in a position to join. 
This is what I had discussed in yesterday's video as well. But that part is now missing unfortunately, so sorry for that. 
So that is how you apply to the vacancies of the grade of assistant professor. 
I worked at Galgotia's College for 1.5 years before I quit that job. 
 
I have one more suggestion for those who want to apply as an assistant professor in private engineering colleges to teach bachelors classes. 
There is a website: facultyplus.com which I had extensively used. 
You will get to see a list of all the colleges where there are vacancies & all related details on the site. 
These are colleges all over India. You can apply filters based on location of your preference, 
or based on your choice of departments and subjects you could teach. 
There are many such filters. Its a good website. They keep notifying you for every new opening that applies to you. 
SO just visit the website, and whichever application deadlines are close, start applying there first. 
So all students who are now studying in IITs, NITs or any other colleges and want to apply as assistant professors can easily use facultyplus.com 
And ifs these colleges do not recruit from your college placement season, 
apply off campus. It has 2 benefits. 
1. You can negotiate salary. 
This is not possible on campus placements. 
If you start negotiating salary on campus interviews, they may just hire some other student. 
But in the off campus setting it is just you, and you get a better chance of getting the salary you want by proving your worth. 
2. You have a wider choice set to choose from. 
You are not dependent on the companies or colleges that recruit from your campus placements. You are not waiting for them. 
You go to the companies/colleges. So it is a different scenario this time. 
So obviously,  there are different advantages to applying on campus and off campus. 
Lastly, keep applying, cold emailing and appearing for interviews. 
Make use of facultyplus.com 
And all the very best.

Video 4: What is a good GATE score? GATE score formula

 
Dear friends, after huge public demand,
I am making this video! 
About 80% people asked me to make a 
video on the concept of GATE SCORE!  
So here it is! 
Do you know how many people voted? 
Five People! 
OF those 5, four were of the opinion 
that a GATE SCORE video is needed! :D 
That's why I am here... ! 
Anyway, sad life! :) :( 
Jokes aside, 
in this video we will understand which 
  is important, GATE Score, or Rank. 
We will see how you can gauge your GATE SCORE by looking at your marks 
and I will share some of my own experiences from GATE 2014. 
It will help you understand 
why GATE Score is important, 
and why GATE rank or marks 
are not as important.. 
We will also see why GATE score 
is used, and its formula too. 
So, watch this video to the end! 
 
Alright! So, you all know that, GATE -  
let's say for mechanical or electrical engineering, 
is not conducted in a single day. 
It is conducted on different days, 
with different paper sets. 
And, the questions are also not repeated. 
The difficulty is also different for each paper set. 
SO, when some (students) get 
the easier paper set,  
they get higher marks. 
Similarly, some others will get the difficult paper, 
and will also score less. This is INJUSTICE! 
To avoid this injustice, marks are normalized. 
Even after normalization, 
you know that - say in an IIT -  
in a branch like control system engineering, 
a student from mechanical engineering is eligible,  
and a student from electrical
 engineering is also eligible. 
How do you compare the two? 
The both wrote two different GATE papers. 
To be able to compare these two, 
their GATE marks are compared
 "relatively" with each other. 
Meaning, comparing with 
the respective toppers' marks, 
and their qualifications too. 
To quantify all these factors and make them comparable, GATE SCORE is introduced. 
You all know that GATE marks 
are calculated out of 100 
 
- say 50 or 60 (out of 100). 
And GATE Score is calculated 
out of 1000.  
Out of 1000, 800+ or 900+ scores 
are considered excellent. 
Around 600-650 is decent score. 
400-500 GATE score is .. just OKAY.. 
But below that, the score is 
just NOT good. 
This is the first thing to understand. 
 
I want to share my own 
experience with you. 
In 2014 I attempted GATE 
for the first time. 
My scores were as follows: Marks = 30 
My GATE rank for 30 marks was 452! 
It was an amazing rank. 
I had 'heard' that this is a respectable ranking. 
But my branch was Instrumentation. 
And few people appear 
for GATE Instrumentation. 
And that is why the 'good rank' 
needs to be actually very very good! 
And to convey this, the 
GATE SCORE was printed right there, 
 but I wasn't paying any attention to that! 
I was just focusing on the rank, 
and I kept thinking that this is great!! 
I really believed that I would get admission at the best institute!  
What happened was, that year, for a long period of time, I kept applying to all the possible institutes happily.. 
But finally, I was admitted nowhere.
And then I was a bit shocked too! 
It was then that I understood that I 
should have focused on the GATE score. 
So, if I had done that, I would have better
 understood my position (in the competition)  
and would have made better decisions. 
So it is of utmost importance that 
right now, you check your marks, 
then calculate / guess / estimate your GATE score. 
And after that, 
it would be easier for you to make decisions 
regarding admissions and also PSUs. 
 
So, let's start with GATE score formula. 
Here is the GATE score formula. 
Let's first read it. 
350 plus 550 times some fraction.  
The fraction is (M-Q) divided by (T-Q) 
Now let's understand the meaning of each term. 
Q represents the qualifying marks (for that subject) 
You all know that 25 is generally 
the qualifying threshold in GATE. 
But in the last few years, it has been observed that the qualifying score has increased for each subject. 
It is usually around 33 - 35 now a days. 
After Q, what does M represent? 
M represents the marks obtained by you out of 100. Right! 
M-Q is the numerator. 
So, now you know the numerator! 
For example, 
if qualifying marks in your paper are say, 25... 
and suppose you score 50,  
Then M-Q is obviously 25. 
Now, lets see the denominator. 
The denominator has T minus Q in the fraction. 
T represents the mean (average) of the 
top 0.1% scores obtained by students. 
Now, this value is difficult to directly guess. 
But you can do the following:  
You can simply ask your peers for their marks, and choose the highest marks. 
Or you can also just arbitrarily use 80 or 90 or even higher marks (for the sake of this calculation.) 
T is the mean of the marks of the few topper students. 
So, T simply means toppers' marks.  
So now you have toppers marks 
minus qualification marks. 
Now if you assume the mean of toppers' marks as 90,  
and qualification marks = 25. 
Then the denominator is 65 
Then the value of this fraction for your marks, which is 50,   
the toppers' mean marks (assumed) is 90,  
The value of the fraction becomes 0.385. 
Now multiply that by 550. 
And add 350 to it. 
That is your GATE score. 
So lets calculate. 0.385 times 550 = 211.5 
Add 350 to that,  
and your GATE score is 561. 
Now 50 marks in GATE seems a lot... 
but the score is JUST OKAY.. 
 
You might get a few interview calls, 
and you can appear for them.. 
But your GATE score should be a bit bigger. 
So the threshold you need to cross is around 600 - 650 GATE score if you want admission at a good institute. 
I was quite lucky. 
In 2015, with GATE score 652 
I could secure admission in IITD. Very lucky indeed! 
So that's how you can calculate your GATE score! 
Now, the toppers' marks T -  
we assumed it to be 90 in the last example, 
which is slightly inflated. 
It is usually not so high. 
The mean is lower. 
So, be hopeful, calculate or estimate your range... 
you will be now in a position to make better decisions. 
It is important to note that if your marks M equal the qualification marks Q, then your GATE score will be 350. 
And if you are a topper, your GATE score will be close to 900. 
So if you get scores above 900, then 
you are probably at AIR under 10, or say 50! 
And if you get marks below the qualification marks, 
then you are in a soup. 
Your GATE score is less than 350. 
So frankly, 350 is a very bad GATE score. 
Above 600-650, it is decent. 
700 score means great! 
800, awesome!!  900? You are the topper!!!! 
remember this. 
GATE score is  like a rank. 
It will help you fight for admission in 
interdisciplinary courses, and also in PSUs. 
That is what GATE score is all about. 
 
If you have any doubts on this, 
please leave a comment. 
And please friends, vote more on my polls... Pleeeeeease! 
Yo all my subscribers, 
please put your votes. They matter! 
If you cannot see the poll, 
it means you haven't subscribed! 
So, if you like this video, please subscribe.. 
Share it as much as possible for all 
the others who might be confused 
about the GATE score, rank, and all the similar stuff. 
This is what they need to know. 
Also remember that many other students 
have scored exactly as many marks as you have. 
So it happens that one score will have several ranks. So, don't worry too much about it. 
You might not be able to guess the rank, 
but a good GATE score will definitely tale you places! 
We'll meet soon with a new video. Till then, gyan peete rahiye!! 


Video 5: QS/NIRF ranking for colleges

हेलो दोस्तों स्वागत है आप सभी का इस चैनल 
पे मेरा नाम है देवाशीष एंड दिस इज एनड शप 
प्रोडक्शन वेलकम बैक टू द चैनल दोस्तों आज 
के वीडियो में हम यह बात करने वाले हैं कि 
यह जो इंस्टिट्यूट रैंकिंग्स होती हैं ये 
कैसे डिसाइड होती है रिसेंटली एक न्यूज़ 
आई थी येल यूनिवर्सिटी जो है यूएस में 
उन्होंने 
क्यूएसजी था क्योंकि येल को यह लगता है कि 
यह रैंकिंग के पीछे दौड़ते हुए 
यूनिवर्सिटीज फेक पब्लिकेशंस फालतू के 
साइटेड बहुत ज्यादा ऐसी चीजें करते हैं कि 
जिनसे उनका ध्यान एक्चुअल रिसर्च से हट 
जाता है और रैंकिंग में सिर्फ अपने जो 
नंबर्स है वह बढ़ाने में सारी एनर्जी लग 
जाती है और इस वजह से उन्होंने क्यूस 
रैंकिंग में से अपना नाम ही हटा दिया बहुत 
सारी यूनिवर्सिटीज यह करती है कि अपना नाम 
हो फेम हो इसके लिए एनआईआरएफ रैंकिंग्स हो 
गई इंडिया में वो करवाती है या फिर क्यूस 
रैंकिंग में पार्ट लेती है और उसे उनका 
मार्केटिंग होता है आपने सुना ही होगा 
आईआईटी भी शेयर करती है हमेशा हर साल की 
क्यूस रैंकिंग में हम अभी अंडर 200 आ गए 
हम अंडर 150 आ गए इवन इन द पास्ट हमारे 
राष्ट्रपति जी ने भी यह शेयर किया हुआ है 
कि 
क्यूएसक्यू वर्सिटीज देखो कितनी आगे आ गई 
है इट्स अ बिग डील फॉर इंडियन 
यूनिवर्सिटीज एज वेल अ या फिर ऑल अराउंड द 
वर्ल्ड जो भी यूनिवर्सिटीज है उनके लिए 
बहुत मैटर करता है कि 
क्यूएसपी में बात करेंगे कि कौन सी चीजें 
हैं कि जिनके वजह से ये रैंकिंग बढ़ती है 
और क्यों इंडियन यूनिवर्सिटीज बहुत ज्यादा 
अच्छी रैंकिंग नहीं ला पाती कभी-कभी और 
कौन सी चीजें मैटर करेंगी तो सबसे पहले 
बात करेंगे कि एनआईआरएफ रैंकिंग में 
यूनिवर्सिटीज कैसे फेयर करती है और कौन से 
पैरामीटर्स पे फेयर करती हैं हम बहुत 
ज्यादा डिटेल्स में नहीं जाएंगे क्योंकि 
बहुत ज्यादा एब्रिवेशन है बहुत ज्यादा 
फॉर्मूले है जो एनआईआरएफ यूज़ करती है 
कॉलेजेस को ग्रेड करते हुए लेकिन 
मोटा-मोटा पांच चीजों पे ये ग्रेडिंग दी 
जाती है सबसे पहली जो चीज है वो है टीचिंग 
लर्निंग और रिसोर्सेस का यूटिलाइजेशन तो 
इसमें आता है फैकल्टी टू स्टूडेंट रेशो 
आता है उसमें स्टूडेंट स्ट्रेंथ आता है 
उसके बाद कितना बजट एलोकेट आपको हुआ था 
कितना आपने यूटिलाइज किया बहुत अच्छे से 
ये सारी चीजें इसमें आ जाती है तो ऑफकोर्स 
जितने ज्यादा स्टूडेंट उतना ज्यादा स्कोर 
जितना हर फैकल्टी के पीछे कम से कम 
स्टूडेंट्स उतना स्कोर ज्यादा मतलब ज्यादा 
अटेंशन मिल रहा है सारे स्टूडेंट्स को या 
फिर पीएचडी क्वालिफाइड फैकल्टी अगर ज्यादा 
है या फिर ज्यादा एक्सपीरियंस वाली 
फैकल्टी आपके कॉलेज में है तो आपका स्कोर 
ज्यादा बढ़ेगा तो ये सारे मैट्रिक पहली 
चीज में आता है दूसरा जो मैट्रिक है उसमें 
रिसर्च प्रोफेशनल प्रैक्टिस एंड 
कोलैबोरेटिव परफॉर्मेंस आएगा अभी इसमें 
क्या आता है इसमें आपने कितने पब्लिकेशंस 
किए उसके बाद आपके पब्लिकेशंस का इंपैक्ट 
स्कोर कितना था मतलब क्वालिटी कितनी थी तो 
इसके पीछे भी कॉलेजेस बहुत ज्यादा फैकल्टी 
को पुश करती कि आपके हर साल इतने इतने 
पब्लिकेशंस आने चाहिए इतने इतना इंपैक्ट 
स्कोर आना चाहिए इसलिए आप हमेशा देखोगे 
इवन इन आईआईटी बहुत सारी फैकल्टी 
स्टूडेंट्स को पुश करती है कि यार पेपर 
पब्लिश करो पेपर पब्लिश करो ज्यादा अच्छे 
जर्नल में जाना चाहिए क्योंकि इस पे उनके 
प्रमोशंस डिपेंडेंट है और इन सारी चीजों 
पे एक्चुअली कॉलेज का प्रमोशन डिपेंडेंट 
है कॉलेज कितना अच्छा रैंकिंग लाएगा ये 
डिपेंड करता है इसमें आईपीआर और पेटेंट्स 
भी आते हैं और फैकल्टी डेवलपमेंट 
प्रोग्राम्स भी आ जाते हैं तो ये हमेशा आप 
देखोगे कॉलेज ये कंडक्ट कर रहा है फैकल्टी 
के लिए तीसरी जो चीज है इसमें ग्रेजुएट गए 
आउटकम आ जाता है अभी ग्रेजुएशन आउटकम क्या 
है तो कितने सारे लोग 
एंटरप्रेन्र्दे लोग हायर स्टडीज के लिए गए 
ये सब मैटर करता है लेकिन बहुत जगह अपने 
इंडियन कॉलेजेस एंटरप्रेन्र्दे 
र बन गए या फिर ज्यादा लोग हायर स्टडीज के 
लिए गए जैसे टियर टू कॉलेज है जिसमें बहुत 
अच्छी किसी को प्लेसमेंट मिल गई तो कॉलेज 
हमेशा ये ब्रांडिंग करता है और उस कॉलेज 
को बहुत ज्यादा फायदा हो जाता है तो एक दो 
लोगों की वजह से भी कॉलेज को बहुत ज्यादा 
फायदा हो जाता है इन चीजों में जो चौथी 
चीज है उसमें आउटरीच और इंक्लूजिविटी आती 
है तो इसमें वमन स्टूडेंट्स का परसेंटेज 
देखा जाता है आल्सो वमन फैकल्टी का भी 
इसमें परसेंटेज देखा जाता है तो इसलिए 
कॉलेजेस हमेशा यह रेशो बरकरार करने की 
कोशिश करता है क्योंकि हमें बहुत पुराना 
जोक पता है कि इंजीनियरिंग में लड़कियां 
नहीं होती लेकिन ये चेंज हो रहा है इसको 
एनआईआरएफ भी प्रमोट कर रहा है आउटरीच और 
इंक्लूजिविटी में स्पेशली एबल लोगों के 
लिए जगह होना या फिर इकोनॉमिकली और सोशली 
बैकवर्ड लोगों के लिए भी जगह होना बहुत 
ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट होता है किसी कॉलेज में 
परस एक पांचवा मैट्रिक है एक पियर ग्रुप 
में परसेप्शन कैसा है तो इसमें कॉलेज का 
मार्केटिंग बहुत ज्यादा मैटर करता है आप 
देखते होंगे कोई गैदरिंग होती है जिसमें 
किसी ने अर्जित सिंह को बुला लिया किसी ने 
और किसी स्टार को बुला लिया और बहुत बड़ा 
फंक्शन करवाते है इससे परसेप्शन बढ़ता है 
कि यार ये कॉलेज बहुत सही होगा इसमें 
सिर्फ पियर परसेप्शन नहीं है इसमें 
एंप्लॉयर का परसेप्शन भी है कि एंप्लॉयर 
को क्या लगता है कि कौन से कॉलेज में जाना 
चाहिए तो एक बार भी किसी कंपनी ने बोल 
दिया कि हां मैं इस कॉलेज में जाके जॉब 
देना चाहता हूं तो वो बहुत ज्यादा मैटर 
करता है इन सारी चीजों को लेके एनई आर फ 
रैंकिंग का एक स्ट्रक्चर बनता है और आप 
खुद सोच सकते हो कि एक कॉलेज ये सारी 
रैंकिंग बनाने के लिए क्या-क्या करता होगा 
ये तो एनआईआरएफ रैंकिंग है इसमें 
इंटरनेशनल तो कुछ है नहीं अब आते हैं 
क्यूएसक्यू एस रैंकिंग की बात बहुत अलग है 
क्यूएसडब्ल्यू पेशन उसके बाद एंप्लॉयर 
रेपुटेशन उसके बाद फैकल्टी टू स्टूडेंट 
रेशो साइटेक्स फॉर फैकल्टी इंटरनेशनल 
फैकल्टी रेशो एंड इंटरनेशनल स्टू ट रेशो 
हर डिसिप्लिन के हिसाब से इन जो 
पैरामीटर्स को जो वेटेज दिया जाता है वह 
अलग होता है जैसे आर्ट्स की स्ट्रीम में 
या फिर इंजीनियरिंग की स्ट्रीम में इन 
सारे पैरामीटर्स को इक्वल वेटेज नहीं दिया 
जाएगा लेकिन इंजीनियरिंग जैसे कोर्स में 
क्योंकि यह बहुत ग्लोबल कोर्स है इसमें 
इंटरनेशनल फैकल्टी रेशो या फिर इंटरनेशनल 
स्टूडेंट रेशो यह भी गिना जाएगा बिकॉज़ 
इंडिया इज अ थर्ड वर्ल्ड कंट्री यहां पे 
रहना सस्ता भी है लेकिन यहां पे जो लाइफ 
स्टाइल है वो इतनी अच्छी नहीं जो यूरोप 
में लोगों को मिलती है या फिर यूएस में 
लोगों को मिलती है इस लिए बहुत ज्यादा 
इंटरनेशनल फैकल्टी आप यहां पे नहीं देखते 
या फिर इंटरनेशनल स्टूडेंट्स भी आप यहां 
पे नहीं देखते जितने आप यूएस में देखते हो 
या फिर यूरोप में देखते हो इस वजह से 
इंटरनेशनल फैकल्टी रेशो या फिर इंटरनेशनल 
स्टूडेंट रेशो में इंडियन आईआईटी मार खा 
दिए और इन दो चीजों की वजह से अपनी 
रैंकिंग बहुत अच्छी नहीं जा पाती एक कुछ 
टॉप कोर्सेस है जैसे आईआईटी बॉम्बे का 
सीएस हो गया आईआईटी दिल्ली का सीएस हो गया 
फिर इलेक्ट्रिकल हो गया कुछ चंद कोर्सेस 
है आईआईटी में जिनमें बहुत-बहुत 
अच्छे-अच्छे फैकल्टी जो इंटरनेशन ली यहां 
पे आते हैं या फिर स्टूडेंट्स भी होते हैं 
कि जो इंटरनेशनल स्टूडेंट्स जो ऐसे 
कोर्सेस में आके पढ़ते हैं तो इन लोगों की 
वजह से इन कोर्सेस का रैंकिंग बहुत अच्छा 
हो जाता है यूएस में याद रखना सिर्फ कॉलेज 
का रैंकिंग नहीं होता हर डिसिप्लिन का 
रैंकिंग अलग होता है जैसे आईआईटी दिल्ली 
का इलेक्ट्रिकल का सीएस का रैंकिंग अलग 
होगा और टोटल आईआईटी दिल्ली का रैंकिंग 
अलग होगा थोड़ा सा मार हम इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर 
में भी कभी-कभी खा लेते हैं क्योंकि यहां 
पे जो पीएचडी की सिचुएशन है वो वो थोड़ी 
खराब है जो गवर्नमेंट से जो फंडिंग आ रही 
है रिसर्च के लिए वो रिलेटिव टू यूएस डज 
इज वेरी वेरी लो तो रिसर्च में हमारा यहां 
का जो स्टूडेंट है जो पीएचडी कर रहा है वो 
मेहनत तो बहुत कर रहा है साइटेक्स निकाल 
रहा है पेपर पब्लिश हो रहा है क्वालिटी भी 
बहुत सही है लेकिन इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर से 
सपोर्ट नहीं मिल पाता और इन कुछ चीजों की 
वजह से इंडियन यूनिवर्सिटीज क्यूस रैंकिंग 
में थोड़ा सा मार्क आती है तो ऐसा नहीं है 
कि क्यूस रैंकिंग में आईआईटी बॉम्बे या 
फिर आईआईटी दिल्ली 150 वें रैंक पे है 
इसका मतलब वो एमआईटी या हार्वर्ड से कंपीट 
नहीं कर पाती बेसिकली दे आर एक्चुअली देयर 
बट कुछ ऐसे चंद पैरामीटर्स होते हैं जिनकी 
वजह से हमारी यूनिवर्सिटीज मार खा लेती है 
तो आईआईटी का परसेप्शन बाकी बहुत अच्छा है 
रिसर्च एंप्लॉय बिलिटी बहुत सही है कल्चर 
भी बहुत सही है लेकिन यह क्यूस रैंकिंग्स 
अगर आप अच्छे से जान लो तो आपको यह पता 
चलेगा कि मैटर क्या कर रहा है तो कभी भी 
ऐसा इनफीरियर 
कॉम्प्लेक्शन लेवल जो चीजें मैंने 
एनआईआरएफ रैंकिंग में थोड़ी डिटेल में 
डिस्कस की यही सारी चीजें क्यूस रैंकिंग 
में भी मैटर कर रही है छोटी-छोटी चीजें 
होती है जिसके वजह से हमारी यूनिवर्सिटी 
पीछे रह जाती है और सारा देश हल्ला बोल 
देता कि यार अभी तक हम टॉप टॉप 50 में 
नहीं आए अभी तक हम टॉप 20 में आए बल्कि 
बहुत ऐसे कोर्सेस है जैसे आईआईटी बॉम्बे 
का सीएस हो गया आईआईटी दिल्ली का 
इलेक्ट्रिकल हो गया ये बहुत इतने बढ़िया 
काम कर रहे हैं रिसर्च इतना सही चल रहा है 
बाकी फैक्टर्स इतने आउट वेट कर देते हैं 
कि टॉप 50 में आ जाते हैं लेकिन ये कोई 
एडवर्टाइज नहीं कर रहा तो हमेशा से ध्यान 
देना जब भी बाहर अप्लाई करो खुल के करना 
और बहुत अच्छे से करना क्योंकि आप बहुत 
पेलम कॉलेज में हो ठीक है मैं ऐसे ही आपके 
सामने अलग-अलग कंटेंट लाता रहूंगा अगर 
आपको ये वीडियो अच्छा लगा हो तो जरूर लाइक 
कर देना सब्सक्राइब कर देना एंड सी यू सून 
ऑन द अदर साइड मिलेंगे जल्दी एक नए वीडियो 
के साथ तब तक के लिए ज्ञान पीते रहिए बाय

Video 6: Core vs interdisciplinary branches

हेलो दोस्तों स्वागत है आप सभी का इस चैनल 
पर मेरा नाम है देवाशीष और एड्स अपने 
प्रोडक्शन वेलकम बैक तू डी चैनल फर्स्ट ऑफ 
जो रियली सॉरी पर दिस लाइटिंग आज इसी तरह 
वीडियो बनाना पद रहा है आज मैं बात करने 
वाला हूं ब्रांचेस में जो पढ़ाई होती है 
वो 
कर ब्रांचेस में पढ़ाई होती है वो कौन सी 
ज्यादा डिफिकल्ट है कौन सी आपको इजी जाएगी 
और कौन सा बेसिक डिफरेंस होता है दोनों 
ब्रांचेस के एग्जाम्स में या फिर आप ऐसे 
समझ सकते हो की पढ़ाई में किस तरह का आपका 
अप्रोच होना चाहिए जब आप आईआईटी में इंटर 
करते हो या फिर नीत में इंटर करते हो यू 
नो आई हैव ऑलरेडी टॉक अबाउट की कितना 
खतरनाक पेपर निकाल सकता है प्रोफेसर को 
बहुत ज्यादा फ्री टाइम होता है सो दे कैन 
एक्चुअली सेटअप अन्य किड ऑफ पेपर और कभी 
कभी ऐसे पढ़ाई बहुत टू हो जाति है बहुत 
सारे लोगों को तो ये बहुत जनरल सा सवाल 
आते हैं आता राहत है की क्या आईआईटी इसमें 
पढ़ाई डिफिकल्ट होती है 
तो हां इतस में पढ़ाई डिफिकल्ट होती है और 
इसकी भी मैं बात कर चुका हूं ऑलरेडी इसके 
बड़े में जो भी वीडियो में डिस्क्रिप्शन 
में लिंक कर दूंगा लेकिन आज जो समझना वाली 
चीज है की एक अगर आप एंट्री डिसीप्लिनरी 
ब्रांच चीज करते हो तो आपको 
भी पढ़ाई को फेस करना पद सकता है और अगर 
आप कर ब्रांच में जाते हो तो क्या स्ट्रेट 
होगी सबसे बेसिक डिफरेंस जो होता है 
इंट्रडिसीप्लिनरी ब्रांच और कोबरा ब्रांच 
पे वो स्प्रेड और डेप्थ का होता है ठीक है 
स्प्रेड का मतलब है आप ज्यादा चीज पढ़ने 
हो इन क्वांटिटी जी तरह से अगर मैं इसको 
बोलूं की ज्यादा टॉपिक आप पढ़ोगे बहुत 
सारे सब्जेक्ट्स को मिला के बहुत 
डायवर्सिफाइड सब्जेक्ट्स आपको मिलेंगे 
इंटेरेंडरी ब्रांच है क्योंकि इंटर 
डिसीप्लिनरी ब्रांच में बहुत अलग-अलग 
ब्रांचेस से लोग आते हैं और बिकॉज़ ये जो 
प्लेईंग फील्ड है जो एग्जाम का प्लेईंग 
फील्ड है वो लेवलाइज होने के लिए कोई भी 
प्रोफेसर ऐसा नहीं करता की किसी पर्टिकुलर 
नीचे में किसी पर्टिकुलर एक्सपर्ट 
सब्जेक्ट में उसने बहुत ज्यादा टू पेपर 
निकाल लिया वो बेसिक कॉन्सेप्ट भी पूछेंगे 
हर जगह थोड़ा सा डेप्थ में जाते हैं लेकिन 
दे क्लीयरली डू नोट को इन एन लोट ऑफ डेप्थ 
व्हेन आईटी कॉम तू इंटर डिसीप्लिनरी 
ब्रांच लेकिन आपको क्वांटिटी में बहुत 
ज्यादा चीजों को टच करना पड़ेगा और 
एग्जांपल मैं एनर्जी स्टडीज में था आईआईटी 
दिल्ली में तो फ्यूल टेक्नोलॉजी 
एनवायरनमेंट और इकोलॉजी भी पढ़ा था उसके 
बाद हमने हिट ट्रांसफर भी पढ़ा था तो हमने 
बहुत ज्यादा अलग-अलग सब्जेक्ट्स पढ़े मैं 
इंस्ट्रूमेंटेशन इंजीनियरिंग के 
बैकग्राउंड था तो इलेक्ट्रॉनिक से भी 
रिलेटेड चीज थी जैसे हम सोलर फोटो टैक्स 
पढ़ने थे फ्यूल सेल्स पढ़ने थे उसमें 
इलेक्ट्रॉनिक का पार्ट आता था तो वो 
मैकेनिकल के बंदों को थोड़ा सा समझना में 
टू जाता था मेरे को हिट ट्रांसफर या फिर 
अक्सर जी वो वाला कॉन्सेप्ट थोड़ा समझ में 
टू चला जाता था लेकिन इनको मिला के सबका 
जो सिलेबस था वो बहुत डायवर्सिफाइड था 
लेकिन हर हम बहुत ज्यादा डेप्थ में नहीं 
जाते थे कुछ ही गिने-चुने सब्जेक्ट्स हैं 
की जिम हम डेप्थ में चले जाते थे तो 
इंट्रडिसीप्लिनरी ब्रांच में थोड़ा सा 
पढ़ाई का मामला अलग होता है आपको बस चीजें 
पता हनी चाहिए क्वांटिटी क्वांटिटी में 
अलग-अलग बेसिक कॉन्सेप्ट भी अगर आपको ए 
रहे हैं तो यू कैन बिल्ड अप ऑन डेट 
लेकिन अगर आप कर ब्रांच उसे कर रहे हो 
आपकी अगर इलेक्ट्रिक इंजीनियरिंग में बी 
टेक हुई और अगर आप पावर सिस्टम में पावर 
इलेक्ट्रॉनिक में अगर आप मैच कर रहे हो 
उसमें बहुत ज्यादा डेप्थ होती है पढ़ाई की 
और आईआईटी जैसी जगह पे लोगों ने मतलब 
प्रोफेसर लोगों ने बहुत होशियार होशियार 
लोग देख चुके होते हो तो उनके दिमाग में 
स्टैंडर्ड सेट होता है की आओ उसे 
पर्टिकुलर बैच का जो एग्जांपल है वो याद 
रखते हैं जो भी उनकी फेवरेट होती है तो 
उन्हें के हिसाब से पेपर निकलते रहते हैं 
और बहुत टू पेपर निकलते हैं और बहुत 
ज्यादा बार ऐसा बोला जाता है इसके लोग 
बोलते हैं की हमारा पेपर बहुत टफ आता है 
नोबडी इसे बिल तू स्कोर लेकिन ऑफ कोर्स वो 
लेवल्स हो जाता है नॉर्मलाइज हो जाता है 
पर इंटर सिस्टम के वजह से बिकॉज़ स्टॉपर 
जहां पे होता है वही से आपका पेंटर राहत 
है सो डरने की वैसे ही बात नहीं होती ना 
ही इंटरी ब्रांच में ना ही को ब्रांच में 
लेकिन पढ़ाई का जो अप्रोच है वो अलग होना 
चाहिए अगर आप इंट्रडिसीप्लिनरी ब्रांच में 
हो तो यू शुड बी एबल तू लर्न न्यू थिंग्स 
वेरी क्विकली क्योंकि आप एकदम ही कंपलीटली 
नई चीज पढ़ोगे तो आपको करना थोड़ा मुश्किल 
ब्रांच में लेकिन अगर आपके दोस्तों से ही 
अगर आप पढ़ लिए तो आपको बहुत चीज ये आसन 
हो जाएगी वेयर अगर आप कर ब्रांच में चले 
जाते हो तो आपको एक्जिस्टिंग नॉलेज पे 
बिल्ड करना होगा आपका एक्जिस्टिंग नॉलेज 
जो है वो बहुत ज्यादा स्ट्रांग होना चाहिए 
ऐसा नहीं की आपको नई चीज ही कुछ पढ़ते 
आपका फायदा होता फायदा होता है ऐसा कुछ 
नहीं है लेकिन एक्जिस्टिंग चीज पे आपको 
बिल्ड करना होता है इसलिए आपके 
फंडामेंटल्स आपके एक्जिस्टिंग सब्जेक्ट 
में बहुत ज्यादा स्ट्रांग चाहिए तो जब आप 
चॉइस करोगे इंट्रडिसीप्लिनरी ब्रांच का या 
फिर कर ब्रांच का हाय हिल्स में और नाइट्स 
में अभी थोड़ी-थोड़ी दिन में एडमिशन होना 
शुरू हो जाएगा तो ये चीज ध्यान रखना की 
किस तरह आपको पढ़ाई को अप्रोच करना है और 
आई होप ये वीडियो अगर आपको पसंद ए रहा 
होगा तो जरूर लाइक कर दीजिए कंटेंट अच्छा 
ग रहा है तो सब्सक्राइब कर दीजिए मैंने 
जॉइन बटन भी ऑन कर दिया चैनल पे अभी वांट 
तू बी एन मेंबर ऑफ दिस चैनल एक्सप्लोर डेट 
जॉइन बटन और आपको मैं मेरी सर्विसेज 
प्रायोरिटी पे प्रोवाइड करूंगा एवं डेट्स 
आईटी पर दिस वीडियो मिलेंगे जल्दी ही एक 
नए वीडियो के साथ तब तक के लिए 

Video 8: Does career gap matter?

Hello friends, welcome to the channel,  my name is Devashish and this is an Ed Sharpener Production. 
Welcome back to the channel. 
 Today I am going to talk about my experience in the two interviews that I appeared for in the past month. 
after a huge career gap. 
My regular viewers know my story, about who I am, what I do, 
where I am from, where I have studied, etc 
But for those who are new, let me tell you that I used to work as a freelancer, 
and I post graduated from IIT Delhi in the year 2017. 
After completing my B.Tech in 2014, I got a job and continued it till 2015 
as an associate design engineer, in control system department in Fluor Daniel. 
So that was one of my industrial experiences for one year 
After that I completed my M.Tech, and after that,  
I formally joined another job, as an assistant professor. 
So, basically, I wanted to get into the education (industry). 
I wanted to be a faculty (member), wanted to pursue PhD, and what not ! 
So I first took that job as an assistant professor, I was a faculty (member) there. 
And you can also watch and listen to all my experiences as a faculty member, I have put a link up here. You can of course watch it. 
And, I quit that job in one and a half years. And after that I started working as a freelancer. 
I would provide a variety of services in the education sector, based on my own capabilities and skill set. 
Me and my wife - yeah I was married at that time, after my post graduation -  me and my wife then started this channel. 
So, we used to work as freelancers, and we would earn a living out of it. It used to work fairly well for us. 
So this is the normal introduction about me and my occupations. 
If you want to know in exact details about all the companies and startups that I have worked with, 
.. all the people that I was (and am still) connected with, you can just visit my LinkedIn page, whose link I will share in the description (box).   
You can just visit the LinkedIn Page and just walk (scroll) over. 
I have also made a lot of videos about all these freelance websites from where I used to earn,  on this channel. 
They are a bit older videos, so you can go and browse those videos.  
So if you too want to earn money part-time, you can start working with those companies. 
I started visiting LinkedIn much more often in the month of June 
and I would keep looking in the 'jobs' section. I also updated my profile a bit. 
I updated my profile picture, and made my LinkedIn profile look neat and clean. 
And after doing all this, I started applying for jobs. 
And right after I started applying, luckily, within about 15-20 days, I started getting back replies. 
So, I mainly applied for two jobs. I appeared for these two interviews, and will talk about these two (in this video). 
So, basically, the energy think tank company from New Delhi that I applied to is called TERI. 
You can search about it. So, TERI is about Energy Consulting. And, they are (also) into policy making, and I think it is very interesting. 
I was craving for that.. so that is one thing! 
And the other company was Tutero, which is an Australia based Ed-Tech Startup. I also applied here. 
So, let's first talk about TERI. 
The job description at TERI matched very well to the skill set I have, alright! 
So, I applied via email. Here is the screenshot of my application email, so you can just go through how I applied. 
In an application email, one shouldn't write too any unnecessary details. Just apply for the post, and wait for the reply. 
Luckily, I got the reply, and luckily I got the chance to interview for them. 
Now, I know you are waiting to know how an interview goes after a career gap. It is important to note about me and my career gap that 
even I didn't know how the interviewers will interpret my resume. It was great news for me that at least my resume was selected.   
What I found is that the panelists (interviewers) get an idea (about you) looking at your resume. 
What they are interested in knowing is how good you are at your technical skills. 
So, if the job is technical, they are interested in knowing your technical achievements from the past. 
Now, since I applied for energy consulting, they asked me about my instrumentation engineering, all the basics. 
I was asked me about PID controller. I was asked about my major project. (also about) what I had done at IIT Delhi while in Energy Studies (Department)... 
... where I used my Instrumentation knowledge for the M.Tech Project.  
They asked me more about my B.Tech Project. They asked me more about this YouTube Channel. They asked me more about my freelance experience. 
At the same time, I had omitted the detail of me being an assistant professor in my resume 
because I wanted to make a one-page resume. And since my freelance experience is a lot more, I chose to write only things  
which I thought would be appropriate while applying at (a company like) TERI. 
So, I just deleted that detail about me being an assistant professor. They found a gap there, and asked me, 
about the one and a half year gap, and what I did during that period.  
I explained it to them that I was an assistant professor. But unfortunately, I don't have an experience certificate. 
So, I chose not to put that in the resume. They were fairly ok with that.  
What is important to understand here, is that when you get asked such uncomfortable questions, 
about your career gaps (or similar), you have to justify the gap confidently. 
What do I mean by justification? I had a very simple justification, a real reason - I don't have the experience certificate! But I have done something. 
At the same time, you can also have completed some certification courses (in your gap),  
... freelance work, internship with some company, tried to startup, tried to prepare for UPSC... 
WHATEVER you have done, if that was an "HONEST EFFORT", nobody will care. This is important to understand. 
By the way, if you are putting you honest efforts for ANY exam preparation, then Testbook Pass is the best deal for you according to me. 
For a very small amount of money, you can prepare for 450+ exams and more than 43000 tests. 
Basically this means that, you get access to the test series covering GATE, UPSC, PSC (state level), Banking and what not by subscribing ONLY ONCE.  
You will get the test series of all  exams 
Now, today I am making this video, and if you use this code EDS10 within the next 3 days to subscribe for TESTBOOK, you get this pass for 18 months instead of 12 months.  
If you buy it after the validity is over (3 days after) you will get a 12 months subscription. 
So, I think this is a great deal if you are an exam aspirant. And this will help you prepare very well. You can find this link of Testbook pass in the description, so please visit it! 
Now, let us jump back to our video. A lot of people worry about their career gaps. 
Now, it's been about 2-3 years since I launched this channel, and when people ask me about what to do about their career gaps,  
I always tell them the same thing. You don't have to DO something! 
For the career gap, if you have a genuine and honest reason,  
say, for instance if you are a lady, and you went through pregnancy and delivery,  
it's a very natural and honest reason. So, no need to worry about that part.  
And the men, they can also say that, "I became a father, and I took a break!" You can just tell the honest effort that you made! 
I have talked to a lot of people about this very common issue. Then, I also got to know about the interviewer's side of the story.  
They too are not interested in knowing that you took a job only, or some internship only..  
People tell them that they tried preparing for UPSC, or GATE. People also tell them that they had been on a (long) solo trip. 
Or of course then there is pregnancy, etc. So the reasons can be many! 
But of course, you have to tell about your honest efforts. See, I am not saying that every company's interviewer will accept your application... 
But see what I am trying to tell you. I am now 29 years old. My interviewer was probably around 40 years old.  
He was cool with whatever reasons I told.  And I think the people of my age, who are probably sitting on the interviewer's chair 
.. they will accept your reasons because, I think our generation, people of my age group, they are more willing to understand that.. 
some people try UPSC. People go through a lot of different stuff. People go through bad times. So, they are more willing to listen to your side. 
So, if you have put honest efforts, you need not worry about your career gaps.  
When this moment comes in your interview, just talk about it honestly and confidently. Get it over with! I guarantee that no one will remember that. Don't be afraid. 
Just apply with confidence, and wait to get shortlisted.  
That's all I was asked about career gap. 
After that I was asked about my certifications, they went through my resume, and all about that.  
They then asked me . "You have a YouTube channel. Now you have a family, You are a freelancer. You live in Maharashtra, will you relocate to Delhi?" 
I could have answered this better. I said, "I would choose to work remotely. But if you (company) insist, I will relocate." 
I should probably not have said that. I should have straight away said that I can relocate and settle in Delhi. 
So yeah, I tried to convince them that I can relocate. And they also considered my age, and the fact that I have settled with a family. 
So that's how that interview went. They also told me that I am technically very sound. 
I made a video earlier about Kandpal Sir and how his connection helped me in an interview. This was that interview. 
So they recognized where I was from, they recognized my professor, and they were very impressed with that! 
I am still waiting for the result though! I still don't know TERI interview results till this moment when I am recording about that interview! 
I think that it is going to be a NO... probably because... I don't know! Could be any reason. 
I haven't taken that personally, the reason could be anything. But definitely, the reason of rejection is absolutely not my career gap. Understand this. 
Now, second thing.   
The other interview that I had appeared for parallelly with TERI was a company called Tutero. 
And very luckily I got a chance to apply for a position which was matching with my profile. I have a lot of experience in Ed-Tech. 
Since the beginning, I have worked with several startups, I have worked on content (creation), video making,  
I have also worked in the field of "HOW to teach", I have some very good managerial experience as well. 
My experience with Tutero was awesome. At first I was shortlisted with my resume. Then there was a small assignment.  
After that there was a type form submission, like a video interview. 
And then there was a final interview. And I am happy to tell you that I have been selected there. I have taken that job, so that's the update! 
What I learnt from that is that: whatever that you have done in life till now, it will be rewarded sooner or later. 
It's remote work, I will talk to the founders, and ask if it possible to show you their metaverse office and all! 
But I am not sure, so I am not going to tell a lot! The thing is, I will work there full time, Monday to Friday. 
It's a lot of freedom for me. I like the work immensely. And I am really happy that I have started (working) there. 
I now officially have a job after a long time. So... I appeared for two interviews after a career gap. One has probably resulted in a NO, it was my core domain.. 
The reason was not career gap. They were probably convinced that I would no move and settle in Delhi.  
And the other one - Tutero - it's an Australian startup and I have started my new journey with them. 
So, this is what I wanted to share with you all. And here is the conclusion.  
Even if you have career gap, 'darna mana hai'. Don't be afraid. You can confidently and honestly justify your career gap. 
Just tell the honest reasons. Do not try to hide it. Do not try to make up for it. It is okay that you have career gaps. 
And people of my generation, who are out there as interviewers, they understand your side. And it doesn't matter, jobs are out there! 
Literally, I started applying in June, and I actually finalized my job offer in 21 days! 
So that's how it went. Keep doing. Keep giving your best honest efforts. And you will get a job. 
Just try to work on your skills, which is the most important part. At the same time, stay confident and stay honest with your gaps, Its ok to have them. 
After you've watched this video, if you want to know anything else, let me know in the comments section. 
Please like the video so that it reaches as many people as possible. 
Apart from this, I want to invite different people on our channer for podcasts, so that we get to know the interviewer's side of the story. 
We will also try to invite people who have career gaps due to competitive exams like UPSC, and we will try to understand how they still managed to transition their careers. 
So, stay tuned and we'll meet soon in a new video. Till then, 'Gyan peete rahiye' ! TATA!
